### ðŸ”¹ **Virtualization**

**Definition**:
Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of physical hardware such as servers, storage devices, and networks. It enables you to run multiple operating systems or applications on a single physical machine by using **hypervisors** (like VMware, VirtualBox, KVM, etc.).

**Why it's important in cloud computing:**

* Improves resource utilization by sharing physical hardware across multiple users.
* Reduces hardware costs and energy consumption.
* Provides easy scalability and backup/recovery options.
* Each virtual machine (VM) runs independently and can have different operating systems.

### ðŸ”¹ **Containerization**

**Definition**:
Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization. It involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a **container**, which can run on any system that has the container runtime (e.g., Docker).

**Key Benefits:**

* Lightweight (shares host OS kernel)
* Highly portable and consistent across environments
* Faster startup than VMs
* Better resource efficiency

**Popular tools**: Docker, Podman, containerd

### ðŸ”¹ **DevOps**

**Definition**:
DevOps is a combination of **Development** and **Operations** practices that aim to automate and integrate software development and IT operations.

**Goals:**

* Faster development and release cycles
* High collaboration between dev and ops teams
* Improved product quality and monitoring
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

**Key Concepts in DevOps:**

* Automation
* Continuous Testing
* Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)
* Monitoring & Feedback
