* **Image**: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application (code, libraries, environment variables, etc.)

* **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry where Docker images are stored and shared.
* **Docker Engine**: The core software that hosts and runs the containers.
