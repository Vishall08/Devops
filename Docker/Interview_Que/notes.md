Great initiative, Vishal! I checked your GitHub repo: [Devops → Docker folder](https://github.com/Vishall08/Devops/tree/main/Docker), and you've covered a lot of Docker fundamentals already (installation, basic commands, Dockerfile, Docker Compose, networks, volumes, Nginx reverse proxy, etc.).

Below is a **comprehensive list of Docker interview questions**, broken into two parts:

---

## ✅ Part 1: **Based on Your GitHub Repository**

These questions are based on topics you have already documented:

### 🐳 **Docker Basics**

1. What is Docker and how is it different from virtual machines?
2. Explain the Docker architecture (Docker Engine, Daemon, CLI, Images, Containers).
3. What are the benefits of using Docker?
4. How do you install Docker on Linux?
5. What is the role of the Docker daemon?
6. What is the difference between `docker run` and `docker start`?
7. What does the `--rm` flag do?

### 🛠️ **Docker Images & Containers**

8. How do you create your own Docker image?
9. What’s the difference between a container and an image?
10. What is the purpose of the Dockerfile? Explain each instruction (`FROM`, `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, etc.).
11. What is a base image vs parent image?
12. How do `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` differ?
13. What is the purpose of `.dockerignore`?

### 📦 **Docker Volume & Persistence**

14. How does Docker manage data persistence?
15. What is the difference between `bind mounts`, `volumes`, and `tmpfs`?
16. How do you create and attach a volume to a container?
17. What is the default location of Docker volumes on the host?

### 🌐 **Docker Networking**

18. What types of Docker networks are available?
19. How do you connect multiple containers using a bridge network?
20. How do you inspect the network configuration of a container?
21. What happens if two containers expose the same port?

### 🧱 **Docker Compose**

22. What is Docker Compose?
23. How does `docker-compose.yml` work?
24. How do you define multiple services in a Docker Compose file?
25. What is the difference between `build` and `image` in Docker Compose?
26. How do you use environment variables in Docker Compose?

### 🌐 **Reverse Proxy with Nginx**

27. What is a reverse proxy? How did you configure Nginx as one?
28. How do you link Nginx to other containers using Docker Compose?

---

## 🚀 Part 2: **Advanced & Missed Concepts (Not in Your Repo Yet)**

These are important concepts you didn’t cover explicitly in your GitHub but are often asked in interviews:

### 🔐 **Security**

29. How can you secure Docker containers?
30. What is Docker Content Trust (DCT)?
31. How can you prevent privilege escalation in Docker containers?

### 🎯 **Multi-stage Builds**

32. What is a multi-stage Docker build? Why is it useful?
33. How do multi-stage builds help reduce image size?

### 🧪 **Testing & Debugging**

34. How do you troubleshoot a Docker container that won’t start?
35. How do you view logs of a container?
36. What does the `docker inspect` command do?

### 🛑 **Container Lifecycle & Management**

37. What are the different container states (created, running, paused, exited)?
38. How can you remove all stopped containers?
39. What’s the difference between `docker pause` and `docker stop`?

### 📦 **Docker Registry & Hub**

40. What is Docker Hub?
41. How do you push and pull Docker images?
42. What is the difference between a private and public registry?

### ⏱️ **Performance & Optimization**

43. How can you reduce the size of a Docker image?
44. What are some best practices for writing a Dockerfile?
45. What is layer caching and how does it affect build speed?

### 📊 **Docker Stats & Monitoring**

46. How do you monitor resource usage of containers?
47. How can you limit CPU and memory usage for a container?

### 🔁 **Restart Policies**

48. What are Docker restart policies?
49. What is the difference between `no`, `on-failure`, `always`, and `unless-stopped`?

### 🧱 **Docker Swarm (Optional if interviewer asks about orchestration)**

50. What is Docker Swarm? How is it different from Kubernetes?
51. How do you create a Docker Swarm cluster?
52. What are services and tasks in Docker Swarm?

## 📋 Bonus: Dockerfile Interview Scenario

You may be asked to analyze or fix a Dockerfile. Prepare to:

* Explain what each line does
* Identify optimization issues (e.g., combining `RUN` commands)
* Add multi-stage build or volume
* Create a Dockerfile for a specific app (Node.js, Python, PHP)

---

## 📘 Preparation Tip:

Prepare short answers with real examples from your GitHub repo. Practice hands-on:

```bash
docker ps
docker images
docker logs <container_id>
docker-compose up -d
docker build -t myimage .
```
